**Milestone:** Able to solve 20–30 basic coding problems and explain time/space complexity.

## Step 3: Intermediate Problem Solving
**Why to learn:** Strengthen problem-solving by practicing medium-difficulty challenges. This helps develop strategies for tackling more complex coding problems and builds confidence in critical thinking.  
**Topics:** Sliding window, prefix sums, binary search variations, two pointers.  
**Milestone:** Confidently solve 50+ medium-level problems on coding platforms.

## Step 4: Advanced DSA
**Why to learn:** Prepare for challenging coding problems with advanced concepts and patterns. Focus on optimization techniques and data structures that appear in competitive and real-world scenarios.  
**Topics:** Advanced math, backtracking, tries, string pattern matching, advanced dynamic programming, graph theory.  
**Milestone:** Interview-ready for top product company coding rounds.

## Step 5: SQL & Databases
**Why to learn:** Efficiently manage, query, and manipulate structured data, a critical skill for backend development and data-driven applications.  
**Topics:** SELECT queries, joins, aggregations, window functions, indexes, normalization, transactions.  
**Milestone:** Write optimized SQL queries for real-world datasets.

## Step 6: Backend Development
**Why to learn:** Understand how servers work and build backend applications. Learn application architecture, APIs, databases, and scalable system design.  
**Topics:**  
- **Software Design Principles:** SOLID, design patterns, UML, schema design, API design.  
- **Backend Development:** TCP/UDP/HTTP, MVC, LLD, unit testing, ORM, deployment, Git, Spring Boot/Node.js/Django.  
**Milestone:** Deploy your first backend service with APIs.

## Step 7: Fullstack Development
**Why to learn:** Expand backend knowledge to include frontend technologies, building complete applications end-to-end. Integrate UI with backend services while considering best practices, deployment, and performance.  
**Topics:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, OOP in JS, concurrency, DOM manipulation, event handling, API integration, deployment, frontend LLD.  
**Milestone:** Launch a full-stack project connecting frontend and backend.

## Step 8: High-Level Design (HLD)
**Why to learn:** Learn to design scalable, reliable systems for millions of users. This prepares for system design interviews and real-world architecture decisions.  
**Topics:** Consistent hashing, caching, CAP theorem, distributed databases, scalability, Kafka, microservices, case studies (Twitter, Uber, WhatsApp).  
**Milestone:** Confidently explain and design scalable architectures in interviews.

## Step 9: Data Engineering
**Why to learn:** Gain expertise in handling big data and building data pipelines. Learn tools and techniques to extract, transform, and analyze data efficiently for data-driven products.  
**Topics:** Data processing systems, advanced SQL, ETL pipelines, MapReduce, Spark, cloud services, data warehousing, workflow orchestration, monitoring.  
**Milestone:** Build a production-level ETL pipeline with dashboards and monitoring.

## Step 10: Product Thinking for Engineers
**Why to learn:** Understand product management concepts to contribute beyond coding. Learn product discovery, roadmap planning, prioritization, and analytics to influence product development.  
**Topics:** Product discovery, roadmaps, prioritization, analytics, case studies, delivery management.  
**Milestone:** Confidently participate in product discussions and roadmap planning.

## Step 11: Generative AI for Engineers
